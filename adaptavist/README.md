# Adaptavist Assessment
-----------------------

This assessment consists of 2 parts in order to test on the familiarity of Kubernetes & previous handson projects.

## Requirements
### Part 1:
Implement a solution that takes a file and prints a word count of its contents. The output should consist of a line for each word, with the number of its occurrences in the file. It should be sorted by the number of occurrences starting with the most frequent word. Ensure the validation of the output is automated as part of your solution.

Use Kubernetes platform to run the above solution. You are free to use any K8s cluster or minikube to run the application.

### Part 2:
As part of the face to face interview, we would like to discuss a previous project youâ€™ve worked on. This should ideally be an infrastructure project, including some diagram of the infrastructure and how Kubernetes or equivalent Container Orchestration platform is used. We will ask probing questions about the solution to get an understanding of your thinking and decision-making behind the design whilst also enquiring about any improvements you would have liked to make.
