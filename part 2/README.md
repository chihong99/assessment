# Infrastructure Diagram
------------------------

## Introduction
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Kubernetes cluster on cloud services to achieve scalability, reliability, and ease of management for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## Objectives
**Scalability**: 
  - Enable the infrastructure to scale horizontally to handle varying workloads.
**Reliability**:
  - Ensure high availability of applications by minimizing downtime and providing automated failover mechanisms.
**Ease of Management:**
  - Simplify the deployment and management of applications through automation and centralized control.

## Design Considerations
**Multi-Region Deployment:** 
  - Able to deploy Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions for business growing.
**Multi-Zones Scalability:**
  - Able to scale the node across multiple availability zones in the same regions for fault tolerance.
**Cross-Cluster gRPC Communication:**
  - gRPC services across different clusters in different regions are able to communicate.
**Security:**
  - Implementing security best practices, such as RBAC, to protect the cluster and applications.
